Hi there :wave: My name is Felix and I'm a Computer Scientist, originally from the beautiful town of [Saarbrücken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarbr%C3%BCcken), Germany.

Currently, I'm visiting the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard SEAS](https://seas.harvard.edu/) to conduct my master's thesis, which is part
of my master's degree in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).
Previously, I completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), where I spent a term abroad at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) in Ireland.

In the past, I've done research on Gaussian Splatting Distillation at [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/about-us/), worked as a Software Engineer at [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/) and as a
Machine Learning Engineer at [Validaitor](https://www.validaitor.com/) and [Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com). Prior to that, I did an internship at the R&D department of [Porsche](https://www.porsche.com) in Weissach, Germany.

Outside of work, I'm a football fan (that's european football and yes, it's called football, not soccer) and a
big supporter of Borussia Dortmund and my home club 1. FC Saarbrücken. I follow Formula 1 whenever I can and I'm a big car enthusiast in general.
